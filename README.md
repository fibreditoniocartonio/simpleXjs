# simpleXjs
A simple action platformer in javascript, with the idea to make it become a metroidvania sooner or later.

## Usage
Just download all the files and open the .html.<br>
Load the .savegame file to play with all the implemented functionalities.
You can even play it directly from browser at [https://fibreditoniocartonio.github.io/simpleXjs/](https://fibreditoniocartonio.github.io/simpleXjs/)

## Assets
I'm not a good artist and to speed up the development of the game engine I'm currently using some assets non-conforming to the GPL3 License.<br>
If you are an artist and want to contribute with some beautiful free assets you can contact me on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7dEmHX39bA).
